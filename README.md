# Screwcap Price Prediction

This study was commissioned by a cosmetics company that wants to estimate the price of Screw Caps for shampoo bottles.
To get a quick estimation of costs, it is possible to build a statistical model to predict the price of products given their characteristics. With such a model, it would no longer be necessary to be an expert or to wait several days to assess the impact of a design modification, a change in supplier or a change in production site.
